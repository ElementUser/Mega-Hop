Mega Hop is a free, easy-to-play platform hopper game that I worked on with a small team. The game involves getting the ball to continuously bounce across moving platforms without going off the level.

I primarily worked on the Leaderboard System of the game, and this repository contains some of the key files used for the Leaderboard System. With permission from our team, I am able to post the code files I primarily worked on.

The game application was developed with Unity and coded with C#. Some higher level concepts were used in the game's overall design (i.e. a Dependency Injection framework via Zenject).
